Design and configure a high available 3-tier Architecture on AWS

    Tier 1 - User/Presentation Tier
    Tier 2 - Application Tier
    Tier 3 - Data Tier






Make VPC
~~● 4 subnets (1 public, 3 private)~~
~~● Enable in subnet settings public ip addresses~~
~~● Make it highly available (use 2 availability zones, the final private subnet can be the only
one in a different subnet)~~
~~● Allocate an Elastic IP~~
~~● Create a nat gateway~~
~~● Create an internet gateway and attach it to your VPC~~

● Make route tables for your public and private subnets and attach an internet gateway
and nat gateway to them respectively

● Make security groups for Bastion Host, web server, app server, and database
● Make sure to go back to security groups after making them and adding security groups
to link them together, for example in the app server security group adding a rule for the
database security group after creating the database security group.
